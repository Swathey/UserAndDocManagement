# User and Document Management System

A comprehensive API-based system for managing users and documents with advanced features including authentication, authorization, document management, and document ingestion processing using a microservice architecture.

## Features

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin, Editor, Viewer roles)
- Secure registration and login workflows
- Protected API endpoints

### User Management
- User CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Role management
- Secure password handling with bcrypt

### Document Management
- Document CRUD operations
- Access control based on ownership and roles
- Document content storage and retrieval
- File path tracking for document storage

### Document Ingestion Service
- Microservice architecture with TCP transport
- Asynchronous document processing
- Status tracking for ingestion processes
- Webhook integration for status updates

### Database
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Relational data model for users, documents, and ingestion processes
- Migration support for database versioning

### Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for all modules
- End-to-end API testing
- Test coverage reporting

## Architecture

The application is built with NestJS and follows a modular architecture:

- **Authentication Module**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **User Module**: Manages user data and operations
- **Document Module**: Handles document storage and retrieval
- **Ingestion Module**: Processes documents asynchronously using a microservice
- **Prisma Module**: Provides database access via Prisma ORM

The system integrates with a Python backend microservice for document processing, using TCP transport for communication.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend Framework**: NestJS 11
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma 6
- **Authentication**: Passport, JWT
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Microservices**: NestJS Microservices with TCP transport
- **Validation**: class-validator, class-transformer

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- PostgreSQL database
- Python environment (for the ingestion microservice)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd user-doc-management
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/user_doc_management?schema=public"
   JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret-key"
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. Run Prisma migrations:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

### Docker Setup (Optional)

A Docker Compose configuration is available for running the application with all its dependencies:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start:
- The NestJS application
- PostgreSQL database
- Python ingestion service

## API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger/OpenAPI. After starting the application, you can access the documentation at:

```
http://localhost:3000/api
```

### Main Endpoints

- **Authentication**:
  - `POST /auth/register` - Register a new user
  - `POST /auth/login` - Login and obtain JWT token
  - `POST /auth/logout` - Logout (client-side token removal)
  - `GET /auth/profile` - Get current user profile

- **Users**:
  - `GET /user` - Get all users (Admin only)
  - `GET /user/:id` - Get a specific user
  - `POST /user` - Create a user (Admin only)
  - `PATCH /user/:id` - Update a user (Admin only)
  - `DELETE /user/:id` - Delete a user (Admin only)

- **Documents**:
  - `GET /document` - Get all documents (filtered by user role)
  - `GET /document/:id` - Get a specific document
  - `POST /document/create` - Create a document
  - `PATCH /document/:id` - Update a document
  - `DELETE /document/:id` - Delete a document

- **Ingestion**:
  - `POST /ingestion/trigger/:documentId` - Trigger document ingestion
  - `GET /ingestion/status/:id` - Get ingestion status
  - `GET /ingestion` - Get all ingestion processes
  - `POST /ingestion/webhook/status/:id` - Update ingestion status via webhook

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Test coverage
npm run test:cov
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add refresh token functionality for enhanced security
- Implement document sharing between users
- Add pagination and filtering for document and user listings
- Create frontend interface
- Set up production deployment pipeline
